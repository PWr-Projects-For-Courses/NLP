HIPISEK QUESTIONS SET

In this directory there are files with questions comming from Hipisek.pl service and from UrzÄ…d Skarbowy (Polish Tax Office).

In 'questions' directory there are files containing questions from those services divided by two subsets.
All questions from 'hipi_part1.csv' (254) and 'hipi_part2.csv' (256) were merged into one set in 'hipi_all.csv' (510) file.
In file 'hipi.csv' (499) there are cleaned and corrected questions from 'hipi_all.csv' set.

All those files have the same structure with sections:

>>>   id ; question_text ; expected_answer_type ; question_class   <<<

where:

> id                    - id of question in data set
> question_text         - question text
> expected_answer_type  - expected type of an answer
> question_class        - stuctural class of a question


In 'questions_answers' directory there are files containing questions from 'hipi_part2.csv' subset with url addresses to answer documents for those questions.
File 'hipi_ans_all.csv' (309) contains mainly questions from 'hipi_part2.csv' subset and some additional questions (any comes from 'hipi_part1.csv' subset).
File 'hipi_ans_clean.csv' (246) contains only questions for which answer document were found, but contains some duplicates. It's obsoleted set and exist only because it was using for tests, earlier then file 'hipi_ans.csv' was created.
File 'hipi_ans.csv' (236) containes cleand and corrected version of 'hipi_ans_clean.csv' set, without duplicates nor language errors.

Those three files have the same structure with sections:
